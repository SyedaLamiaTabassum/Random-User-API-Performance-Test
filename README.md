# Random-User-API-Performance-Test

**Load test:** 
This test was done to check whether the server can handle expected load. Several instances of tests were taken in intervals to observe the error rate and figure out the actual TPS (transaction per second).  

**Stress test:**
This test was taken to determine the max load the server can take. Number of users was increased for a constant amount of time to increase the load on the server.
